Moves
Product overview: Moves leverages GPS tracking and real-time user ratings to provide personalized
recommendations for the top trending spots each day. The app has two main modes:
In Day Mode, students can vote on and discuss the current top-rated locations. The app provides reporting on key
factors like upvotes, historical trending data, and positive reviews to help students decide where to go out that
night. Then in Night Mode, Moves switches to tracking live data things like user foot traffic, pricing, and
downvotes to give students a real-time view of the local nightlife scene.
Beyond recommendations, the app also has social features like an in-app chat function, allowing students to
connect with peers and share their experiences.
From a business perspective, Moves serves two key user groups: college students and bars/clubs. For students, it
solves the common problem of deciding where to go on a given night, empowering them with crowd-sourced
ratings and location data.
For bars and venues, Moves offers valuable marketing opportunities and data-driven insights to better engage the
lucrative college demographic. The app's tracking capabilities provide detailed analytics to help optimize
promotions and offerings.
Our primary goals are to establish Moves as the go-to "partying tool" for college students nationwide, while also
building a robust dataset on student nightlife preferences that we can leverage to provide sophisticated marketing
solutions for venues.
SAHRC
Product overview: SAHRC is an educational technology app designed for children and their parents. The
primary goal is to serve as a learning platform for users to access curriculum, assessments, training videos, and
other educational resources related to social and health services. The app has both web and mobile components:
Instructors use a web-based dashboard to manage the curriculum, upload assessments and training materials, and
download student performance reports. Students and parents access the learning content and complete
assessments through the mobile app.
A key challenge the SAHRC team faced was enabling a seamless single sign-on (SSO) experience across the
web and mobile platforms. However, the app was initially rejected from app stores due to the lack of an SSO
integration. To address this, the team had to go back and implement a robust SSO solution that allowed users to
securely authenticate and access the app's features consistently across devices. This was a critical requirement for
achieving broad user adoption and acceptance.
Overall, the SAHRC app aims to provide a centralized, technology-enabled platform for children and families to
engage with educational content related to social and health services. Delivering a frictionless cross-device
experience through SSO was a key technical hurdle the team had to overcome to achieve this vision.
Instructor Music App
The Instructor Music App is designed to provide fitness instructors with a seamless, gapless audio player for
their workout playlists. The core objective is to create an optimized experience for instructors to manage their
music during live fitness classes.
Key Features:
● Gapless Playlist Playback: To achieve true gapless transitions between songs, the app uses an
innovative approach of creating overlapping audio instances. This avoids the typical gaps that can
occur in React Native's default audio playback.
● Playlist Management: All users can build playlists from their local music library and adjust song
order, BPM, and other metadata.
● Premium Workout Tools: Paid subscribers can create and edit custom Tabata and HIIT cadence
workouts, leveraging the playlist BPM data.
● Single Sign-On: The app integrates with the existing user database from the companion web
application, enabling instructors to access their accounts without having to re-register.
Technical Implementation: The app is built using React Native to provide a consistent, native experience across
iOS and Android platforms. However, we faced a key challenge with React Native's limited audio capabilities.
Initially, we explored bridging React Native with platform-specific SDKs (Swift for iOS, C++ for Android) to
access lower-level gapless audio functionality. But this would have significantly extended the development
timeline. Instead, we developed a custom solution using overlapping audio instances. By carefully managing the
playback of each song in a playlist, they were able to create a seamless, gapless experience without requiring
extensive native code integration.
